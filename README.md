# Happy New Years

You can see the source code of the _Happy New Year_ of every year I made one. Not all pages are in english, some could be in spanish.

- Run `yarn` to install all packages
- Run `yarn build` to build all packages
- Run `yarn dist` to prepare the `dist` folder with all built packages on it
- Run `yarn serve` to serve the `dist` folder locally at port 3000
- Run `yarn serve:docker` to serve the `dist` folder locally using the custom nginx configuration at port 3000
- Run `yarn docker` to build the docker image
- Run `docker container run --rm -it -p 80:80 hny-melchor9000` to run the docker image, and go to [http://localhost](http://localhost) to see the web in action.
- Some projects require the API to be up, go to `packages/hny-api` and run `yarn start`. It requires a vercel account btw...

Have fun :)
